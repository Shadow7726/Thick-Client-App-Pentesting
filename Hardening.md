### Checklist for Thick Client Hardening Testing

1. **Binary Protections**

   - Use [PEdump](https://github.com/un4ckn0wl3z/PEdump) to verify presence of protections like ASLR, DEP, CFG, safeSEH.
   - Attempt to bypass protections like ASLR using memory manipulation tools like [TitanMist](https://github.com/w4kfu/TitanMist).

2. **Code Signing**

   - Use [Sigcheck](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sigcheck) to verify signatures and certificate validity on executables.
   - Check for weak hashing algorithms used for signing.

3. **Traffic Encryption**

   - Use [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to verify SSL/TLS used for network communication.
   - Verify certificate validity and encryption strength.

4. **Input Validation**

   - Use [Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) to validate sanitization of inputs from files, registry, network.
   - Fuzz test inputs using [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) to confirm validation checks.

5. **Logging**

   - Check execution logs for access failures, policy violations, etc.
   - Confirm logging of security-sensitive operations like crypto key usage.

6. **Anti-Debugging**

   - Use [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) and check for anti-debugging measures like PEB checks.
   - Attempt runtime manipulation to bypass anti-debugging and identify weaknesses.

7. **Third Party Libraries**

   - Use [PEframe](https://github.com/guelfoweb/peframe) to analyze third party libraries and dependencies.
   - Check for vulnerable, outdated or blacklisted versions using tools like [Retire.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js).

8. **Access Control**

   - Check for role-based access control for critical functions.
   - Test password quality rules using brute forcing tools like [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/).
   - Verify principle of least privilege within application.

9. **Data Protection**

   - Check for encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   - Verify secure storage of keys and passwords.
   - Check for sensitive data leakage in memory using [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/).

10. **Exploit Mitigation**

   - Confirm mitigations like Arxan, Control Flow Guard, Data Execution Prevention.
   - Attempt memory corruption, code injection, return oriented programming attacks.
   - Test process continuance after simulation of common exploit techniques.

11. **Patch Management**

   - Identify libraries/dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
   - Check version numbers against latest patched releases.
   - Test applying patches does not break intended functionality.

12. **Configuration Security**

   - Analyze app config files for insecure settings, verbose logging, etc.
   - Check for sensitive data like passwords, keys, creds in config.
   - Test by modifying config parameters like access control settings.

13. **Incident Response**

   - Simulate incidents - data theft, malware, unauthorized access.
   - Check alerts, logs, effectiveness of IR procedures.
   - Confirm isolation, containment of compromised components.

The key is to rigorously test defenses against common attack vectors like code injection, memory corruption, credential theft, unauthorized access, etc.
