### Information Gathering

1. **Find Application Architecture:**
   - Use [Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) to view architecture, processes, modules, open handles, etc.
   - Use [TCPView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview) to map out network connections between processes.

2. **Identify Technologies Used:**
   - Use [PEiD](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Packers-Crypters-Protectors/PEiD-updated.shtml) to detect the compiler, packing, and crypto used in executables.
   - Use [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388) to analyze libraries and dependencies in executables.

3. **Identify Network Communication:**
   - Use [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to sniff network traffic to/from the client.
   - Analyze traffic for unencrypted sensitive data.

4. **Observe Application Behavior:**
   - Use [Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) to log file, registry, and network activity.
   - Analyze activity during app usage to identify resources accessed.

5. **Identify Entry Points:**
   - Use [Sysinternals tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) like AccessEnum to find entry points.
   - Test varying users, roles, and permissions to map out entry points.

6. **Analyze Security Mechanisms:**
   - Spider the app to map out the authorization scheme.
   - Test account creation, password rules, and authentication flows.
   - Analyze network traffic for auth token usage.

The key is to combine static analysis of executables with dynamic runtime monitoring during app usage to gather a comprehensive view of the thick client's architecture, technologies, network activity, behaviors, and security mechanisms.

Remember to use these tools and techniques responsibly and only on applications that you have permission to test. Unauthorized information gathering or testing can be illegal and unethical. Always follow responsible disclosure practices and respect the privacy and security of the applications you are testing.
